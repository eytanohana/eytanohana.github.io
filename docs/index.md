# Hi, I’m Eytan

> I like to build things with code.

## At work

I am a backend developer, building APIs and services that are designed to be reliable, maintainable, and easy to reason about.

I care deeply about clean abstractions, clear interfaces, and systems that hold up well over time.

## Personally

I like to build focused projects that explore and illustrate interesting technical concepts.

Often small, intentional implementations meant to make complex ideas clearer.
