# A Graveyard of Docs

*January 25, 2026*

You ask a coworker, "hey, support says this service is acting weird - is there any documentation for it?"

They send you a link to the page. You open it and the first thing you see, right at the top.  
**"Last Edited: 3 years ago."**


That timestamp tells you something important about the system that produced this documentation.
Not just that it hasn't been updated recently, but that no one has been forced to notice that it hasn't been updated.

There's no signal when it drifts out of date. No feedback loop pulling it back towards reality.

You haven't read a single sentence, but already a quiet decision has been made.
The page is no longer authoritative. At best, it might be directionally useful. At worst, actively misleading.

So, before the content even has a chance, trust is already lost.

## Why it happens

Are people just lazy? This pattern is so common it would be harsh, and itself lazy, to apply that explanation across the board.
Even in environments full of capable, well-intentioned people, internal documentation tends to age quietly and lose trust.

That consistency suggests the issue isn’t effort or discipline, but structure.

To understand why documentation so often becomes untrustworthy, it helps to stop thinking of it as a collection of pages
and start thinking of it as a system. One designed with very few signals when it begins to fail.

## Documentation as a System

Any system can be understood by what it rewards, what it detects, and what happens when it fails. Internal documentation is no exception.
Docs are usually written at moments of change: launches, handoffs, incidents, onboarding — but once created, they enter a system with
very little feedback about whether they remain accurate or useful.

The core failure mode is simple: documentation does not break when it is wrong. There is no alert when a page drifts
out of date, no tests that fail when reality changes, and no visible signal when trust erodes.

> Incorrect documentation can live indefinitely, "quietly filling up the graveyard."

The system rewards creation over maintenance. Writing a doc is visible and finite; maintaining one is ongoing and largely invisible.
Small updates rarely feel urgent, and deleting obsolete pages can feel risky. Over time, the system selects for new documentation
rather than accurate documentation.

Systems evolve continuously and when the documentation is decoupled from them, correctness becomes a matter of discipline rather than inevitability.

Finally, most internal documentation has no natural reader. People don’t browse docs proactively — they arrive when something
is already confusing or broken. In that context, even minor signs of staleness are enough to collapse trust before the content has a chance.

The result is predictable. Documentation ages quietly, trust erodes early, and teams learn to route around the docs instead of relying on them.
What looks like neglect is often just the system behaving as designed.

## Working Around the Docs

Knowledge ends up in isolated silos, in individuals, where tribal knowledge rules. "Oh reach out to X, they understand Y"
becomes the norm. As people enter and leave the organization information gets handed down, individual to individual, 
until eventually the people left can only tell you how a system works but no one can say why it works that way.

Eventually, the day comes where you need to make a change in some microservice and there's no one around who has confident
knowledge in the system. So, familiarly, you break your head reading the code, debugging it, reading logs, and mapping 
out edge cases until you become the person with the most knowledge.
