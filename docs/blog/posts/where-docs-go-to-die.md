# Where Docs Go to Die

*January 25, 2026*

You ask a coworker, "hey, support says this service is acting weird - is there any documentation for it?"

They send you a link to the page.

You open it and the first thing you see, right at the top: **"Last Edited: 3 years ago."**


That timestamp tells you something important about the system that produced this documentation.
Not just that it hasn't been updated recently, but that no one has been forced to notice that it hasn't been updated.

There's no signal when it drifts out of date. No feedback loop pulling it back towards reality.

You haven't read a single sentence, but already a quiet decision has been made.
The page is no longer authoritative. At best, it might be directionally useful. At worst, actively misleading.

So, before the content even has a chance, trust is already lost.

## Why it happens

Are people just lazy? This pattern is so common it would be harsh, and itself lazy, to apply that explanation across the board.
Even in environments full of capable, well-intentioned people, internal documentation tends to age quietly and lose trust.

That consistency suggests the issue isn’t effort or discipline, but structure.

To understand why documentation so often becomes untrustworthy, it helps to stop thinking of it as a collection of pages
and start thinking of it as a system. One designed with very few signals when it begins to fail.
