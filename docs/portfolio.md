# Portfolio

A short selection of my projects that I found interesting enough to share.

If you want to collab get in touch!

## Foundations

### **py-ds-academy**
**Python · Data Structures**

A small library implementing classic data structures from scratch.

Built to make core ideas explicit and easy to reason about.

- Minimal, explicit APIs
- Testing first approach (TDD)

```commandline
$ pip install py-ds-academy
```

## Developer Tooling

### **uv-release-tools**
**Python · GitHub Actions**

Helpers for automating version bumps and releases when working with `uv`.

Built to reduce friction and make release workflows more predictable.

---

## Algorithms

### **Hanoi**
**Python · Algorithms · Recursion**

An implementation and exploration of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

🔗 https://github.com/eytanohana/Hanoi

```commandline
$ pip install hanoi-viz

$ hanoi-viz
```

---

### **Python-Sorting-Algorithms**
**Python · Algorithms**

Straightforward implementations of classical sorting algorithms.

Focused on clarity and tradeoffs rather than performance tricks.

---

### **Graph-Algorithms**
**Python · Graphs · Algorithms**

Notebooks illustrating graphs and different graph traversal algorithms.

🔗 https://github.com/eytanohana/Graph-Algorithms

---

### **Data-Science-and-Statistics**
**Python · Algorithms**

Notebooks explaining different topics in Data Science and Statistics.

Includes an interactive app built with [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

### **Machine-Learning-Implementations**
**Python · ML**

Notebooks explaining different topics in Machine Learning.

Includes an interactive app built (you guessed it) with [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

🔗 https://github.com/eytanohana/Machine-Learning-Implementations

## Small, Shippable Projects

### **Not-Not**
**Python · Game Logic**

A small puzzle game clone where a player must quickly reason about boolean logic in order to pick the correct direction to move.
