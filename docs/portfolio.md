# Portfolio

A short selection of projects that reflect how I think about software and systems.

These focus on backend engineering, tooling, and fundamentals — not demos or experiments for their own sake.

---

## Foundations

### **py-ds-academy**
**Python · Data Structures**

A small library implementing classic data structures from scratch.

Built to make core ideas explicit and easy to reason about.

- Minimal, explicit APIs
- Testing first approach (TDD)

## Developer Tooling

### **uv-release-tools**
**Python · GitHub Actions**

Helpers for automating version bumps and releases when working with `uv`.

Built to reduce friction and make release workflows more predictable.

---

## Algorithms

### **Hanoi**
**Python · Algorithms · Recursion**

An implementation and exploration of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

---

### **Python-Sorting-Algorithms**
**Python · Algorithms**

Straightforward implementations of classical sorting algorithms.

Focused on clarity and tradeoffs rather than performance tricks.

## Small, Shippable Projects

### **Not-Not**
**Python · Game Logic**

A small puzzle game clone where a player must quickly reason about boolean logic in order to pick the correct direction to move.

## Earlier Work

Older projects that shaped how I think, but don’t reflect how I build production systems today:

- **Data-Structures (Java)** — CS foundations  
  https://github.com/eytanohana/Data-Structures

- **Neural-Network-in-NumPy** — ML from scratch  
  https://github.com/eytanohana/Neural-Network-in-NumPy

- **LSTM-for-stock-price-prediction** — Using LSTMs to model stock pricing
  https://github.com/eytanohana/LSTM-for-stock-price-prediction

- **Graph-Algorithms** — notebooks illustrating graph traversal algorithms
